it's a vibrant metropolis and serves as

198
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.639
a great introduction to ethiopian

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:33.040
this is a sprawling city and navigating

the busy streets can sometimes feel

206
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.360
challenging

207
00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:38.320
however there are plenty of areas to

208
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.600
visit

209
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.440
including downtown mexico square

210
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.279
the city's old town

211
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.680
some great museums

212
00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:49.360

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:54.519
mercato

214
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.519

olive baboons

ingredient for kochio

a bread like fermented food that is

256
00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:33.480
sometimes used instead of the famous

injera

258
00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.720
cotton weaving and pottery

259
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:04.000
are important sources of livelihood here

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.000
as is agriculture

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.240
the dorts grow their own coffee beans

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.919
the area of console is regarded as the

274

jumping off point for the valley

275
00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:28.320
with incredible villages built on

293
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:53.280
at these destinations often run the risk

294
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:55.600
of turning into so-called human safaris

295
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.360
make sure to interact with people and

296
00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.520
get to understand them

297
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.520
before considering to take any photos

298
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.480
tourism can have a positive effect and

299
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.120
for some of the villages it's an

300
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.120
important or even crucial source of

301
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.120
income

302
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.320

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:19.760
